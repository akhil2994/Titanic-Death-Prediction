# Titanic-Death-Prediction

The project focuses on an application which can classify scenario based on Titanic Massacre. The classification algorithm classifies a person based on their survival status. That is to identify whether the number of lady’s, gentlemen’s, adult or child, which one is more prone to death and which survived. 

It uses Apache Cassandra as the database in the backend and Java for front end. The datasets (records) are inserted in the database using Java. It works on Naive Bayes Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for prediction which is based on the concept of Bayesian Network and Conditional Probability

Dataset is downloaded from UCI repository and saved as a CSV file. The Titanic Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates TITANIC to the four input attributes: class, age, sex, and survival.
